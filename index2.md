## Welcome to my website!

# A quick note:

This page is not meant to be a professional page. At least for now. I want to make this sort of like a blog or some digital footprint for me to feed my ego. Read with caution as these all are one-sided stories. I don't want you to hate them, I mean. If you want to hate something, please hate me and ignore me. Act like I should not have borned or I am a dog barking on an innocent person.

# The Science behind Aukkawut : An Introduction

I am Aukkawut Ammartayakun, an undergraduate Data Science student. My current work is focusing on Swarm intelligence and Natural Language Processing (well, I want to work with false information preventation and optimizing information operation). I have some experiences on deep learning on basic architecture like basic CNN/RNN to cycleGAN, few-shot learning. I also have some experience on machine learning model from regression to tree but I am not used to the professional work yet. I have dealt with some big datasets before but to be honest, I am not actually good at it. In any case, I received the scholarship from Thai government (well, not quite but for a sake of simplicity) to study "Big Data Analytics and Management" which turns out to be my weakness on Data Science. Yay. 

I was in SCiUS program in Silpakorn University (yes, another university). It was good. I recommend it, just don't act like me and you will be fine :) Most of the topics there are easy and I got bored easily for sometimes. Some of them are challenging so don't just read my word and assume stuff. And as you can see this is in Thailand so who cares about your mental state or your life. Only prestige (I hope I spelled it right as it does not matters to me) matters. Well, I mean, the program is good and everything is good. Everyone here are amazing (except some of the teachers that, you know, we live in Thailand). But, I just don't fit into the society. That's all. I was classified as a bad student with bad habit and bad temper (and that is true, don't get them wrong). We can dig in further but I think that is all you need to know for now. Please don't make the same mistake I take if you want to have a happy life there. 

Middle school? Geez. I don't want to talk about the school that said "Science focus" where all of the students must participate on superstition events or the school that wants creativity but forced students to accept the command from the senior students. That school is completely ****** up. They said the school is academic rigorous but all I can see is students cheating and just don't care about test result. Teachers that don't care much about students if they are not the one who they choose. Again, I am just a defect here even if I got chosen to be a student in harder English session or got a award for the one who has curiosity. I really don't care about those stuff (that's why my English is bad). I can also talk about the story here all days but I mean, who will listen to random guy on Internet when they can brainwash themselves with amazing introduction video for the "such a high prestige school"? 

Yes, this sounds kind of hateful but I meant it. I really hate the system. Not like a system system but how people treat the system.

# Contact? I mean, who will read this page anyways.

You want me to talk? Fine, I will talk. Just make an official letter and the outline of the topic that you want me to talk about via email. I will not read Line, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, or other social media for the work. Please respect my privacy.
