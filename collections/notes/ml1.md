## Objective of machine learning

Let say I want to know how much salary I will make after I graduate. How can I do it? One way to do that is to random guess. Ok, let say we assume that our range of my salary would be around $0 to $5000 per month. Now, I have an interval $$[$0,$5000]$$. So, if let say I want to know what is the **probability** that my guess is right within the margin of error $$[x-\epsilon,x+\epsilon]$$, what should I do?
