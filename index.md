# About me

My name is Aukkawut Ammartayakun. An undergraduate student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I study Data Science and love to learn new things about DS. My current research interest is on the **robustness of intelligence system**. This includes but not limited to: Adversarial Attack, Robust U-statistic, Multiagent Systems. Also, I am interested in the **medicine and biological applications from mathematics and statistics**.

## Learning Philosophy

What I value the most is to understand the concept. I don't care whether I will get F or not. What I care is I tried and I understand the concept. I have pushed myself a lot during my freshman and sophomore year to study graduate level courses to deeply understand the concept while making the good foundation for further study when the concept shows up again. It is hard and I risk my GPA for it but I don't care about my GPA. What is worth more is the understanding.
