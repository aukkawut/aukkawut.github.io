## Welcome to my website!

# About me

My name is Aukkawut Ammartayakun. I am an undergraduate student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I study Data Science and love to learn new things about DS. My current research interest is in the **robustness of intelligence systems**. This includes but is not limited to, Adversarial Attacks, Robust U-statistics, and multi-agent systems. I am also interested in the **medical and biological applications of mathematics and statistics**.

## Learning Philosophy

What I value the most is to understand the concept. I don't care whether I will get an F or not. What I care about is I tried, and I understood the concept. I have pushed myself a lot during my freshman and sophomore years to study graduate-level courses to deeply understand the concept while making a good foundation for further study when the concept shows up again. It is hard, and I risk my GPA for it, but I don't care about my GPA. What is worth more is the understanding.
