## Welcome to my website!

# A quick note:

This page is not meant to be a professional page. At least for now. I want to make this sort of like a blog or some digital footprint for me to feed my ego.

# The Science behind Aukkawut : An Introduction

I am Aukkawut Ammartayakun, an undergraduate Data Science student. My current work is focusing on Swarm intelligence and Natural Language Processing. I have some experiences on deep learning on basic architecture like basic CNN/RNN to cycleGAN, few-shot learning. I also have some experience on machine learning model from regression to tree but I am not used to the professional work yet. I have dealt with some big datasets before but to be honest, I am not actually good at it. In any case, I received the scholarship from Thai government (well, not quite but for a sake of simplicity) to study "Big Data Analytics and Management" which turns out to be my weakness on Data Science. Yay.
