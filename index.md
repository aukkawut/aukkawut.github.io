# About me

My name is Aukkawut Ammartayakun. A rising junior (3rd year) undergraduate student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I study Data Science and love to learn new things about DS. I am working on NLP and statistical learning. I also interested in discussing the philosophical idea behind eastern animations (also known as, anime). Those things are similar to math where we can make our own world (space, per se) with our own rules (axioms, theorems, etc.) and think about how the anime world is constructed and how to break it (like how imaginary number is introduced). That is my goal: to make the model that understand (or explain) the world.

I am also intereted in computer security, especially on the machine learning related one. I competed in some CTFs, but I did it to learn new things. I am cryptography and forensic guy. So, please don't hit me with binary exploitation or reversing questions.

By the way, I rarely reuse my slides (i.e. use my old presentation for new presentation) for other purposes. Thus, most of my presentation are fresh.

## Learning philosophy

What I value the most is to understand the concept. I don't care whether I will get F or not. What I care is I tried and I understand the concept. I have pushed myself a lot during my freshman and sophomore year to study graduate level courses to deeply understand the concept while making the good foundation for further study when the concept shows up again. It is hard and I risk my GPA for it but I don't care about my GPA. What is worth more is the understanding.

I took the following classes (course description can be found here: [link](https://www.wpi.edu/academics/calendar-courses/course-descriptions)). You can also request an access to my transcript here (please write the reason on file access request form in Google Drive): [transcript](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b3ABmwZHVLM2yhVOMYPU3Ey_2JBAIamR/view?usp=sharing). Graduate means that class is offered or intended for graduate students (Master/Ph.D.).

### Projects

For projects, please refers to my [Github](https://github.com/aukkawut) repo and please note that most of the projects there are exploratory project for me to learn new things. It might or might not contains any value for the society and I hope that some day I can reach the level that I can work on the project that has real value to the society.

#### Major Qualifying Project (MQP): one of WPI graduation requirement

I was working (with my friend, Palawat) on predicting RNA secondary structure with graph based deep learning approach. We tackling this problem probabilistically (not by minimizing the thermodynamic energy) and found that we actually getting close to compete with the current SOTA model. All of the report and writeups will be available after everything is sorted out.

### Problems/Notes

Example problems I made mainly for high school algebra. Not being used as I am not a teacher but I have a concern that it might be too hard. If possible, please comment me on this or please let me know that you use it on your class as I want to get a feedback on this.

* Practice problems with solutions on Linear and Quadratic functions [link](/collections/GenMath2022/practice_problems/Quadratic.pdf)
* Problem sets (without solutions) on Linear algebra *This is quite hard for high school students* [link](/collections/GenMath2022/practice_problems/LA1_Psets.pdf)
