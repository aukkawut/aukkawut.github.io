# About me

My name is Aukkawut Ammartayakun. A rising junior (3rd year) undergraduate student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I study Data Science and love to learn new things about DS. I am working on NLP and statistical learning. I also interested in discussing the philosophical idea behind eastern animations (also known as, anime). Those things are similar to math where we can make our own world (space, per se) with our own rules (axioms, theorems, etc.) and think about how the anime world is constructed and how to break it (like how imaginary number is introduced). That is my goal: to make the model that understand (or explain) the world. 

I'm planning to do a master degree in Neuroscience at WPI and looking forward to get another master degree in data science at another place.

# Presentations and Projects

### Presentation

Most of the presentation I made can be found here:

* [SCiUS](http://scius.sc.su.ac.th/) @ Silpakorn University (High school level, lectured with Thai language)
  * SC 30253 Biotechnology: Plant nutrients for tissue culture [link](/collections/presentation/biotech_essential_nutrients.pdf)

  * My part of presentation about Neural encoding [link](/collections/presentation/Neural_encoding_2ndHalf.pdf)

### Projects

For projects, please refers to my [Github](https://github.com/aukkawut) repo and please note that most of the projects there are exploratory project for me to learn new things. It might or might not contains any value for the society and I hope that some day I can reach the level that I can work on the project that has real value to the society.

#### Major Qualifying Project (MQP): one of WPI graduation requirement

I was working (with my friend, Palawat) on predicting RNA secondary structure with graph based deep learning approach. We tackling this problem probabilistically (not by minimizing the thermodynamic energy) and found that we actually getting close to compete with the current SOTA model. All of the report and writeups will be available after everything is sorted out.

### Problems/Notes

Example problems I made mainly for high school algebra. Not being used as I am not a teacher but I have a concern that it might be too hard. If possible, please comment me on this or please let me know that you use it on your class as I want to get a feedback on this.
