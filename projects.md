# Projects

Here is the list of projects that I have done. Most of them are without GUI (in another word, most of them are command-line based). If the project is an assignment or work from the class, I will add `[Class_name]`.

This page is a work in progress. The content here is not well refined and might contains mistakes.

## Quorum Sensing [RBE 595/CS 525 Special Topics: Swarm Intelligence]

Let say we have a grid world of size $$L\times L$$. In each grid, we have 1 agent occupies empty space. The specific agent $$A_{ij}$$ can sense their neighbor signal $$\sigma\left(A_{ij}\right)= A_{ij}*\tilde{\mathbb{I}}$$ where $$*$$ is convolution operator and $$\tilde{\mathbb{I}}$$ as a kernel of matrix of size $$3\times 3$$ for $$8$$ neighbors.
